# EVO X Web-based Tuning

<img src="public/demo.png" alt="Logo">

## About the Project

This car tuning software leverages a variety of web technologies to provide in-depth analysis of vehicle data. Key features include:

- ROM file (.bin, .srf) table extraction and visualization ([ECUFlash](https://www.tactrix.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=36) compatible)
- Sensor data (.csv) overlay, filtering, and custom logic application
- Efficient handling of large log files (10k+ entries)
- Multiple log file selection (.csv)
- Combine ROM table and sensor data
- Combine and aggregate tables
- Savable logic groupings
- Downloadable Progressive Web APP (PWA) available for offline use

Although developed for my personal use, the project may be of interest to car enthusiasts or developers working with similar data formats. Please note while it should work with other ECUFlash compatible vehicles, I have only tested on an 2015 EVO X.

## Technologies

This project is pretty much just a DAG in the browser.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - app router - All `use client` so it can be hosted on github pages
- [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) - Handles visual representations of data and relationships
- [expr-eval](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expr-eval) - "A safer and more math-oriented alternative to using JavaScriptâ€™s eval"
- [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) - 3D Surface charts for table visualization.
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - State management
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Simply Pretty
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI/CD
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) Host this WebApp
- [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) - Offload heavy processes to Web Workers.
- [Progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) - Downloadable offline site

## Getting Started

This software does not ship with any files. Please source definition files (.xml) Roms (.bin, .srf) and log files (.csv) elsewhere. If you are unfamiliar with ECU Flash, and EvoScan I suggest you look into those first.

### File selection

This app requires access to 3 different file directories. Which can be set by selecting the buttons on the left tool bar.  
\*Due to security risk the web browser limits file access and these step will be required upon each visit. However, on additional visits the app will remember the selected directory paths and should open directly to them.

|      | Directory Selection                                                                                                                                                                                       | Sidebar                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| XMLs | This directory must include all of your .xml files as many XMLs inherit from other parent XMLs.<br>eg. If you have ECUFlash installed you can find and select the directory that holds all its XML files. | Select your ROM's XML definition \*This file will be remember and auto selected after directory selection on future page visits.                             |
| Roms | Select the directory with your ROM (.bin, .srf) in it.                                                                                                                                                    | Select the ROM you wish view. This will spawn a "Selected ROM" Node on the canvas. Selecting another ROM will automatically reprocess all down stream Nodes. |
| Logs | Select the directory with your log (.csv) in it.                                                                                                                                                          | Select the Log(s) you wish view. Logs created before the selected ROM will appear as greyed out, but can still be selected                                   |

### Usage

Similar to a flow chart this app allows you to spawn `Nodes` with differing functionality. These `Nodes` can be be chained together to accomplish many tasks.

### Node

Here explains how each of the Nodes can be used

| Combine Advanced Table    | Select in `Fork Node` from table            | Combines tables together using custom axis.<br> eg.<br> The `Fuel Map` has Axis y: `RPM` and x: `LOAD` with a table value of v: `AFR`.<br> The `MAP Load Calc` has Axis y:`RPM` and x:`MAP` with a table value of v:`LOAD`.<br> With this Node we can overlay `AFR` from `Fuel Map` on to `MAP Load Calc` using the common `RPM` axis as well as the `LOAD` axis's of the 2 differing tables |

## Development

### Node Boiler

When creating a new Node these files will likely require reference

React flow  
`app/store/useFlow.ts`  
`app/_components/Flow.tsx`

Loadable node  
`app/_components/FlowNodes/FlowNodesConsts.tsx`

Fork  
`app/_components/FlowNodes/FlowNodesConsts.tsx`

### Roadmap

#### General

- Better Table<LogRecord[]> vs Table<string|number> typeguard's - isTableLogRecord, isTableBasic
- ~~Webworkers~~ - ArrayBuffers
- Improve eval variable naming
- Node naming - Allow nodes to have custom names
- Node tooltips/tutorials
- Table select Node
- Custom LogRecord field names

#### LOG

- Auto select logs based on ROM

#### TABLE

- Cell smoothing - Allow table cells to be smoothed based on surrounding cells
- Custom table values
